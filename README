The xarope project is a low profile, simple to run, renderer to
"tubaina" files, as defined by the project currently at
https://github.com/caelum/tubaina
Unlike that java project, xarope aims to stay a single script, 
with no other dependencies than a Python interpreter and
the standard library - so that writers using the Tubaina
markup language can preview their work without having to
worry about complex installs or environment setups.


This is an alpha-quality release, but maybe already useful
for authors, since it can provide a visual clue to 
the markup text.

The code currently performs a hard coded conversion to simple
HTML of individual chapter files, and ignores many of
the less visual tags. (for example, references).
